# E-Komasu

Make as your own comprehensive e-commerce platform call `E-Komasu` aim for individual, any size of organizations with beautify, minimalist UI and high performance with the power of NextJS.

⚠️ This project is under development ⚠️

## Motivation

Building e-commerce platform is not hard but it time consuming to build from scratch. The idea of `E-Komasu` is to reduce the workload for setup and build same logic over and over again (let's assume you already built 10 e-commerce platform with mostly the same logic for each projects, that might be boring to you to create another e-commerce platform with 10 times already.). The goal and motivation of this project is to overcome and reduce that creating same logic over and over again. Instead focus on common logic of e-commerce, change some UI design and add some additional features as you want with your business goal by using and utilizing open-source `E-Komasu` e-commerce template.
